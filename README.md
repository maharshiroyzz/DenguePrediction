# DenguePrediction
Dengue viruses are spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. These mosquitoes also spread Zika, chikungunya, and other viruses.
Dengue is a viral disease that affects millions of people globally each year. Early detection of dengue outbreaks is crucial for effective disease control and prevention. This thesis presents a predictive modeling approach for dengue outbreak forecasting using machine learning techniques. 

The objective of the study is to develop an accurate and reliable model for predicting the likelihood of dengue outbreaks based on historical data. The study uses a dataset of dengue cases in India from 1999 to 2019. The dataset includes various meteorological and environmental variables, which have been shown to be strongly associated with dengue transmission. The study employs feature selection and engineering techniques to identify the most relevant variables for prediction. Various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, are used to develop predictive models. The performance of the models is evaluated using several evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Mean Squared Error(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) and R2 score. The results show that the developed models are effective in predicting dengue outbreaks. 

The study also provides insights into the most significant predictors of dengue outbreaks, which can aid in the development of effective prevention and control strategies. The findings of this study have implications for public health and can be used to inform policymakers and health authorities on the development of early warning systems for dengue outbreaks. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques for dengue outbreak prediction and highlights the importance of using data-driven approaches for disease control and prevention.
